  <p> <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong> </p>

  <p>Pizza is an Italian dish made with a thin dough base topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings. To start, you prepare a soft yeast dough using flour, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil, then let it rise. Once the dough becomes fluffy, it’s rolled out into a circle, spread with tomato sauce (usually made with garlic and herbs), and sprinkled with grated cheese.</p>
  <p>Next, you add your favorite toppings — such as pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, bell peppers, or other vegetables and meats. The pizza is then baked in the oven at 200–220°C (about 400–430°F) for 15–20 minutes until the crust turns golden and the cheese melts. Once ready, the pizza is sliced and served hot.</p>
