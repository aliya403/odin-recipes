<p> <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> </p>
<p>Lasagna is an Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat sauce, béchamel sauce, and cheese. First, ground meat is cooked with onion and garlic, then mixed with tomato sauce and spices, and simmered for about 15 minutes. Separately, béchamel sauce is made by cooking butter, flour, and milk until thick.</p>

<p>The layers are assembled in a baking dish: meat sauce, lasagna noodles, béchamel, and cheese — repeated several times. The top is covered with cheese and baked at 180°C (350°F) for 30–40 minutes. It’s served hot after resting a bit.</p>

<p> <h2>STEPS</h2></p>   

<ol>

<li><h3>Prepare the meat sauce:</h3>
Heat olive oil in a pan and sauté finely chopped onion and garlic until translucent. Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up any lumps. Pour in tomato sauce, season with salt, pepper, and dried herbs. Simmer for 15–20 minutes.</li>
<li><h3>Make the béchamel sauce:</h3>
In a saucepan, melt butter. Add flour and whisk quickly to avoid lumps. Gradually pour in milk while stirring constantly until the sauce thickens. Season with salt.</li>
<li><h3>Prepare the lasagna sheets:</h3>
If using dried sheets, boil them according to package instructions and set aside.</li>
<li><h3>Assemble the lasagna layers:</h3>
In a baking dish, spread a layer of meat sauce, then a layer of lasagna sheets, followed by béchamel sauce and some grated cheese. Repeat layers 3–4 times, finishing with béchamel and cheese on top.</li>
<li><h3>Bake:</h3>
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Place the assembled lasagna in the oven and bake for 30–40 minutes until golden and bubbly.</li>
<li><h3>Let it rest</h3>
Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it stand for 10–15 minutes to set for easier slicing.</li>
